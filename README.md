I'm using this repo to practice using the [{targets}](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/index.html) package and workflow. The code in this repo will read Icelandic grocery price comparisons from [verdgattin.is](https://www.verdgattin.is/) and output things such as a clean dataset and maybe some other stuff down the road.
